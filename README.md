# DePhlate AI Calorie & Diet Tracker

## Project Description
DePhlate is a program to dynamically identify the caloric and nutritional details of any common food item presented to the program through a video feed. The application will take real-time video from a common smartphone camera and process the input to produce an output identifying what foods are present, and how much calories they compose. This output is produced by processing the input through an image recognition program and matching the food item with its corresponding nutritional information from a food database such as the **USDA FoodData** database.

## Demographic
Our design is mainly targeted towards users looking to better their physical health, diet and nutrition in a more accessible format than what is currently available on the market. Users include, but are not limited to; seniors, people focused on weight loss, weightlifters and people afflicted with a chronic health disease that affects their eating, i.e. diabetes, heart disease, obesity. The design seeks to satisfy the publicâ€™s need for more digestible information regarding their food choices and how it affects their daily caloric and nutritional intake.
